# Real-E-State-Dashboard
This Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of real estate property performance and market status. It consolidates sales, listings, pending deals, agents, and price trends, making it useful for real estate firms, agents, and investors to track property portfolios effectively.

At the top, the key metrics show:
Total Properties: 3,000
Sold: 1,045 (35%)
For Sale: 957 (33%)
Pending: 998 (32%)

This distribution highlights a balanced market where nearly one-third of properties are active, another third are pending, and the remaining have been sold.

The days breakdown of property status and price trends chart segments properties by listing duration: over 90 days, 31–60 days, and 0–30 days, helping identify how long properties stay on the market and how that impacts pricing. Longer-listed properties may indicate higher prices or lower demand.

The Property Market Status and Price by Type visualization provides insights into different property categories and their associated price ranges, supporting pricing strategy and demand analysis.

On the left, the Agent panel highlights top agents (e.g., Alex Johnson, Emily Davis, Jane Smith) and their affiliations, making it easier to evaluate agent performance and manage sales pipelines.

The Property List table displays detailed records, including MLS ID, address, city, area (sqft), lot size, price, and status. For example, properties range from Los Angeles to San Diego and Fresno, with statuses like Sold, Pending, and For Sale, offering both micro-level insights and quick reference for decision-making.

Visually supported by a modern house image, the dashboard combines high-level KPIs with detailed property-level data, enabling stakeholders to assess market trends, property performance, agent contribution, and price behavior in one glance.
